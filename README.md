write the code for displaying the images fetched from the API
## step-4
now install the react-infinite-scroll-component for the infinite scrolling
### npm install --save react-infinite-scroll-component

I have implemented the infinite scrolling using NextJS by getting the images from unsplash api. I have also implemented the mechanism which will go to the image page where we will only display the image. I couldn't implement the getting next and previous images as i was having difficult in nderstanding the API.
